To be implemented:
- BSP-Y-035: Filter search by type.
  Suggested implementation is for a dropdown of available types within the search input, in a similar style to how browsers show search options within the address bar


Enchancements:
 - BSP-Y-027: Add confirmation dialog when deleting
 - BSP-Y-034: Only show 'clear' button when search has value
